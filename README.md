# Masters-Project
This repository contains the code and data used for my master's project to find allele-specific interactions in psoriasis GWAS using different clustering methods. 
Psoriasis is a complex skin disease with known genetic risk factors. Recent literature has explored the use of network-representations of allele-interactions to identify sets 
of alleles with high interaction and correlation to psoriasis. In this study, we evaluate the use of alternate graph clustering techniques on genome-wide allele-specific 
networks to overcome limitations in prior work; present an extensive evaluation of the methods and the allele-clusters identified by them. We also present runtime analysis of 
clustering techniques, discuss their scalability and propose future directions.
